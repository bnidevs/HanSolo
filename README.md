## Hypothesis
QuickSort 

## Background
QuickSort is a sorting method based on the function

	**partition**

	Precondition: takes an array of integers *arr* and three integer parameters *a* *b* *c*

	Function: splits the range *a*,*b* of *arr* into an upper and lower portion
				the upper portion consists of numbers > *arr*[*c*]
				the lower portion consists of numbers < *arr*[*c*]

	Postcondition: all indices < *c* have values < *arr*[*c*]
					all indices > *c* have values > *arr*[*c*]
